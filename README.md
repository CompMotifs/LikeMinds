LikeMinds is a lightweight web tool that helps researchers on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) discover potential collaborators or competitors by analysing overlapping likes on posts. It recommends 3 users with similar interests—based on mutual likes—but excludes those you're already following.

## Features

- Enter your Bluesky handle
- Fetch recent liked posts
- Compare likes with other users
- Recommend 3 users with the highest overlap
- Simple web UI to view and follow suggestions

## Ideas
